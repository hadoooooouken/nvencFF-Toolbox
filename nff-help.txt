#ADVANCED ENCODER SETTINGS

#Preset
p1-p7

Set the encoding preset:
p1 - fastest (lowest quality)
p7 - slowest (best quality)

nvencFF default: p3 (good balance between speed and quality).

#Tune
hq, uhq, ll, ull, lossless

Optimizes encoding for specific content types:

hq = High Quality (general content)
uhq = Ultra High Quality (high detail preservation)
ll = Low Latency (streaming)
ull = Ultra Low Latency (real-time streaming)
lossless = Lossless encoding (mathematically lossless)

#Profile
main, main10, rext (HEVC)
baseline, main, high, high10, high422, high444p (H.264)

Sets the encoding profile which determines supported features and compatibility:

main = Standard profile (good compatibility)
main10 = 10-bit color depth (HDR support)
rext = Range Extensions (professional formats)

Higher profiles offer more features but may have reduced device compatibility.

#Level
auto, 1.0-6.2

Specifies the maximum capabilities of the decoder.
Higher levels support higher resolutions, bitrates, and processing requirements.
"auto" lets FFmpeg automatically determine the appropriate level.

#Tier
0 (Main), 1 (High) - HEVC/AV1 only

Controls the tier within a given level:

Main Tier (0) = for most consumer applications
High Tier (1) = for professional broadcasting (higher bitrates)

#Coder
default, auto, cabac, cavlc, ac, vlc - H.264 only

Selects entropy encoding method:

cabac = Context-Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding (better compression)
cavlc = Context-Adaptive Variable-Length Coding (faster decoding)

Default: cabac for best compression efficiency.

#HW Accel
auto, cuda, d3d11va

Selects hardware acceleration method:

auto = Automatic detection
cuda = NVIDIA CUDA acceleration
d3d11va = DirectX 11 Video Acceleration

Recommended: cuda for NVIDIA GPUs

#Multipass
disabled, qres, fullres

Enables multi-pass encoding for improved quality:

disabled = Single-pass encoding
qres = Quarter-resolution first pass
fullres = Full-resolution first pass

Multi-pass provides better rate control but increases encoding time.

#Rate-Control
constqp, vbr, cbr

Selects rate control method:

constqp = Constant QP mode
vbr = Variable Bitrate (better quality, variable file size)
cbr = Constant Bitrate (consistent bandwidth usage)

#Quality level
qp

Constant quantization parameter rate control method (from -1 to 51)

CQP provides consistent quality but variable file size

-cq - not presented at nFF
Set target quality level (0 to 51, 0 means automatic)
for constant quality mode in VBR rate control (from 0 to 51) (default 0)

#Split Encode
disabled, auto, forced, 2, 3 - HEVC/AV1 only

Controls frame-level parallel encoding:

disabled = No parallel encoding
auto = Automatic detection
forced = Force parallel encoding
2/3 = Specific number of parallel encodes

Useful for high-bitrate, high-resolution encoding on GPUs like the 3080/3090, 
which can have 2 NVENC engines active simultaneously. For most consumer cards with only one engine, this setting does nothing.

#Lookahead Level
auto, 0-15

Controls how many future frames are analyzed for rate control.
Higher values improve quality but increase encoding time and memory usage.
0 = Disabled, auto = Automatic selection

#Spatial AQ
Enabled/Disabled

Enables spatial adaptive quantization.
Improves quality in areas with complex textures and details.
Recommended: Enabled for most content

#Temporal AQ
Enabled/Disabled

Enables temporal adaptive quantization.
Improves quality for moving objects and scene changes.
Recommended: Enabled for most content

#Strict GOP
Enabled/Disabled

Forces regular GOP (Group of Pictures) structure.
Improves seeking accuracy but may reduce compression efficiency.
Recommended: Disabled unless specific seeking requirements

#No-Scenecut
Enabled/Disabled

Disables automatic scene cut detection.
May improve encoding speed but reduces quality at scene changes.
Recommended: Disabled for most content

#Weighted Prediction
Enabled/Disabled

Enables weighted prediction for B-frames.
Improves compression efficiency for fading scenes.
Note: Automatically sets -bf 0 when enabled.

#FPS AND SCALING SETTINGS

#FPS Options
source, 60, 50, 30, 23.976, custom

Controls the output frame rate:

source = Maintain original frame rate
60 = 60 frames per second (smooth motion)
50 = 50 frames per second (PAL regions)
30 = 30 frames per second (standard video)

4K = 3840x2160 (2160p)
custom = Manually specify output width (height scales proportionally)

#Interpolation Algorithm
bilinear, bicubic, neighbor, area, lanczos, spline

Selects the scaling algorithm for resolution changes:

bilinear = Fast, low-quality scaling
bicubic = Smooth and balanced quality (default)
neighbor = Blocky, pixelated output (fastest)
area = Soft result ideal for downscaling
lanczos = Sharp and high-quality scaling
spline = Visually best in theory (slowest)

#AUDIO SETTINGS

#Audio Options
disable, source, AAC 96k, AAC 160k, AAC 256k, custom

Controls audio processing and encoding:

disable = Remove audio track completely
source = Copy original audio without re-encoding (fastest)
AAC 96k = Encode to AAC at 96 kbps (small file size)
AAC 160k = Encode to AAC at 160 kbps (good balance)
AAC 256k = Encode to AAC at 256 kbps (high quality)
custom = Manually specify bitrate in kbps

#Audio Bitrate Quality Guide

96k = Acceptable quality for speech podcasts
160k = Good quality for music and general content
256k = High quality, transparent for most listeners
320k = Maximum AAC quality (near transparent)

luma_spatial
    A non-negative floating point number which specifies spatial luma strength. It defaults to 4.0.
chroma_spatial
    A non-negative floating point number which specifies spatial chroma strength. It defaults to 3.0*luma_spatial/4.0.
luma_tmp

Useful when you want to maintain the original variable frame rate characteristics.

#Drop thresh
frame_drop_threshold 0.5

Determines how aggressively frames may be dropped to maintain quality.
Range: 0–1; higher = more likely to drop frames.

#Gamma RGB
eq=gamma_r=1.0:gamma_g=1.0:gamma_b=1.0:gamma_weight=1.0

Adjust gamma correction for each color channel separately.
Values >1.0 make image brighter, <1.0 make image darker.

#Brightness
eq=brightness=-0.15

Values range from -1.0 to 1.0. Negative values darken, positive values brighten.

#Audio fix
loudnorm=I=-16:TP=-1.5:LRA=11

Convert HDR content to SDR using tonemapping.

The three-stage process:

1. Convert to linear light with specified peak luminance (npl)
2. Apply Hable tonemapping algorithm with zero desaturation (desat=0)
3. Convert to BT.709 color space for proper SDR compatibility

This maintains color accuracy and prevents the muted/muddy colors typical of poor HDR conversions.

#Crop to 16:9
crop=iw:min(ih\,iw*9/16):0:(ih-min(ih\,iw*9/16))/2

Crops video to 16:9 by trimming vertical edges only, keeping full original width.

#Rotate
transpose=1

Rotate video 90 degrees clockwise.

The transpose filter accepts the values from 0-3:

    0 = 90° counter-clockwise and vertical flip
    1 = 90° clockwise
    2 = 90° counter-clockwise
    3 = 90° clockwise and vertical flip
